                    <p>
                      Unsplash is a photo discovery platform for free to
                      use, high-definition photos. We (Unsplash Inc., a
                      Canadian corporation) operate the Unsplash website at
                      <a href="https://unsplash.com/">unsplash.com</a> (the
                      “<strong>Site</strong>”) and all related websites,
                      software, mobile apps, and other services that we
                      provide (together, the “<strong>Service</strong>”)
                      with the goal of celebrating and enabling contributors
                      and fostering creativity in our community. Your use of
                      the Service, and our provision of the Service to you,
                      constitutes an agreement by you and Unsplash to be
                      bound by the terms and conditions in these Terms of
                      Service.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF SERVICE CAREFULLY. BY
                      REGISTERING FOR OR OTHERWISE USING THE SERVICE, YOU
                      ARE TELLING US THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTOOD, AND
                      AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS OF SERVICE, INCLUDING
                      OUR

                        >PRIVACY POLICY</a
                      >
                      (TOGETHER, THESE “<strong>TERMS</strong>”). If you
                      don’t agree with anything we propose in these Terms,
                      please don’t (and you don’t have our permission to)
                      use any part of the Service.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      THIS PART IS REALLY IMPORTANT: These Terms require
                      that if we get into a dispute with you relating to the
                      Service (or vice versa), unless you live in the United
                      Kingdom or the European Union, the dispute will be
                      resolved by BINDING ARBITRATION. This means that YOU
                      AGREE TO GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT TO SUE US
                      (OR BE SUED BY US) UNDER THIS CONTRACT (except for
                      some disputes that can be taken to small claims
                      court). Our disputes will be determined by a NEUTRAL
                      ARBITRATOR and NOT A JUDGE OR JURY and you cannot
                      start or join a class action lawsuit. Have a very
                      careful read through Section 18 for the actual details
                      regarding our agreement to arbitrate, which we’ve
                      tried to make fair to our users.
                    </p>
                    <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
                    <p>
                      The Service is designed for use by people who are at
                      least 13 years old. If you are not yet 13, then you
                      can’t use the Service. If you are 13 or older, you
                      promise to us that you have never been suspended from
                      the Service, and promise that your use of the Service
                      won’t break any laws or regulations. If you are using
                      the Service on behalf of a company, organization, or
                      other kind of entity, you represent to us that you
                      have authority to bind the organization to these Terms
                      on its behalf.
                    </p>
                    <h2>3. Accounts and Registration</h2>
                    <p>
                      When you use the Service, you have the opportunity to
                      register an account. We suggest you do register an
                      account, because creating an account on the Service
                      gives you access to special features around discovery,
                      downloading, and contributing to the community. If you
                      do, we ask that you give us some information about
                      yourself as part of the registration process, some of
                      which is required in order to register the account.
                      You promise that all the information you provide is
                      accurate and that you will keep it accurate and
                      up-to-date in the future. We also ask you to provide a
                      password to protect the security of your account. You
                      are responsible for keeping your password safe and
                      confidential. Any activity that happens under your
                      account will be your responsibility. If ever you think
                      that your account may no longer be secure, you need to
                      notify us immediately at
                      <a href="mailto:support@unsplash.com"
                        >support@unsplash.com</a

                    <p>
                      Conditioned on your continued compliance with these
                      Terms, we grant you permission to access the Service
                      only for your personal use.

                    <h2>5. License to Photos</h2>
                    <p>
                      One of the best features of the Service permits you to
                      search, view, and download photographs that have been
                      uploaded by Unsplash users
                      (“<strong>Photos</strong>”). You may download and use
                      Photos from the Service in accordance with, and
                      subject to, the
                      <a href="https://unsplash.com/license"
                        >Unsplash License</a
                      >. We encourage you to familiarize yourself with the
                      Unsplash License, as well as the accompanying FAQs. To
                      be sure you don’t miss it, here’s the crux of the
                      license:
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
                      <p>
                        Unsplash grants you an irrevocable, nonexclusive,
                        worldwide copyright license to download, copy,
                        modify, distribute, perform, and use photos from
                        Unsplash for free, including for commercial
                        purposes, without permission from or attributing the
                        photographer or Unsplash, but this license does not
                        include the right to compile photos from Unsplash to
                        replicate a similar or competing service.
                      </p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>
                      This means that Photos on the Service come with a
                      very, very broad copyright license under the Unsplash
                      License. This is why we say that they are “Free to
                      Use.” Note that the Unsplash License does not include
                      the right to use:
                    </p>
                    <ul>

                      <li>
                        <p>
                          People’s images if they are recognizable in the
                          Photos
                        </p>
                      </li>

                    </ul>
                    <p>
                      If you download photos with any of these depicted in
                      them, you may need the permission of the brand owner
                      of the brand or work of authorship or individual
                      depending on how you use the Photo. Please see our
                      FAQs for more information and, if you still aren’t
                      sure, you should probably talk to a lawyer who knows
                      about these things.

                      update these Terms under Section 12 above, these Terms
                      can only be amended by a written agreement signed by
                      both you and us. You are not allowed to assign or

                      delay or failure to enforce any rights under, or
                      require your compliance with, these Terms will not
                      affect our right to enforce the rights or require your
                      compliance at a later time. If we waive any breach by
                      you of these Terms, we will not be waiving any
                      subsequent breach or your obligation to comply with
                      any terms that you breached. We’ve included paragraph

                      headings do not affect the interpretation of these

                              over any form of any class or representative
                              proceeding. If this Section 18.a.ii is held
                              unenforceable, then the entirety of Section
                              18.a will be deemed void.

                              <em>Arbitration Rules</em>. The arbitration
                              will be subject to article 940 and following
                              of the Code of civil Procedure (Quebec).

                              conducted in Montreal, Quebec.

                              <em>Decision</em>. The arbitrators will render
                              an award within the time frame specified in
                              the Code of Civil Procedure (Quebec). The
                              decision will include the essential findings
                              and conclusions upon which the arbitrators
                              based the award. Judgment on the arbitration
                              award may be entered in any court having
                              jurisdiction to do so. Any damages granted by
                              the arbitrators must be consistent with the
                              terms of Section 16 as to the types and the
                              amounts of damages for which a party may be
                              held liable.

                              with the arbitration.

                              <em>Generally</em>. In the interest in
                              resolving disputes between you and us in the
                              most efficient and cost effective way, you and
                              we agree to resolve any and all disputes
                              arising in connection with these Terms or your
                              use of the Service by binding arbitration.
                              Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in
                              court. It uses a neutral arbitrator instead of
                              a judge or jury, may allow for limited
                              discovery (i.e., pre-trial fact finding) than
                              in court, and usually is not appealable in
                              court. Arbitrators can award the same damages
                              and relief that a court can award. Our
                              agreement to arbitrate claims arising out of
                              or relating to any aspect of these Terms,
                              includes all claims, whether based in
                              contract, tort, statute, fraud,
                              misrepresentation, or any other legal theory,
                              and regardless of whether the claims arise
                              during or after the termination of these
                              Terms. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY
                              ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND UNSPLASH
                              ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY
                              OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT.

                              Terms waives or limits either of our right to

                              in aid arbitration from a court of law, or
                              (iv) to file a lawsuit in a court of law to
                              address intellectual property claims.

                              <em>Notice and Process</em>. If one of us
                              intends to seek an arbitration, then they must
                              first send a written notice of the dispute to
                              the other party, by certified mail or Federal
                              Express (signature required), or, if we don’t
                              have a physical address on file for you, by
                              email (“<strong>Notice</strong>”). Our address
                              for Notice is: Unsplash, Inc., 500—400 rue
                              McGill, Montréal, Que, H2Y 2G1, Canada. Any
                              Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis
                              of the claim or dispute, and (b) describe the
                              specific relief requested
                              (“<strong>Demand</strong>”). You and we agree
                              to use good faith efforts to resolve any claim
                              directly, but if we don’t reach a resolution
                              within 30 days after the Notice is received,
                              you or we may start arbitration proceedings.
                              During the arbitration proceeding, the amount
                              of any settlement offers by you or us will not
                              be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the
                              arbitrator makes a final decision and award
                              (if any). If our dispute is resolved through
                              arbitration in your favor, we will pay you the
                              greater of: (i) the amount awarded by the
                              arbitrator (if any), (ii) the last written
                              settlement offered by us to settle the dispute
                              prior to the arbitrator’s award, and (iii)
                              $10,000.

                              <em>Fees</em>. If you commence arbitration
                              under these Terms, we will reimburse you for
                              your payment of the filing fee if your claim
                              is for $10,000 or less. Otherwise, the payment
                              of filing fees will be decided by the AAA
                              Rules. If your claim is for $10,000 or less,
                              you can choose whether the arbitration is
                              conducted (i) solely on the basis of documents
                              submitted to the arbitrator, (ii) via
                              telephone, with no in-person hearings, or
                              (iii) by an in-person hearing as established
                              by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of
                              your billing address. If your claim is for
                              more than $10,000, the arbitration hearings
                              will take place at a location that we agree
                              upon in Los Angeles County, California. If the
                              arbitrator rules that the substance of your
                              claim or the relief you seek in the Demand is
                              frivolous or brought for an improper purpose
                              (as measured by the standards in Federal Rule
                              of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of
                              all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules and
                              you agree to reimburse us for any amounts we
                              previously paid but for which you are
                              obligated to pay under the AAA Rules. The
                              arbitrator will issue a reasoned written
                              decision sufficient to explain the essential
                              findings and conclusions on which the decision
                              and award (if any) are based. The arbitrator
                              may make rulings and resolve disputes
                              regarding the payment of fees or expenses at
                              any time during the proceeding and upon
                              request from either party made within 14 days
                              of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.

                              person’s claims and may not preside over any
