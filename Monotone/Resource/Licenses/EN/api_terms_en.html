                      party content such that users of your Developer Apps
                      cannot attribute the Content to Unsplash.

                      You will comply with all applicable privacy laws and
                      regulations, including those applying to personal data
                      and, where applicable, the GDPR. You will provide and

                      URLs returned by the API in your Developer Apps
                      (generally referred to as “hotlinking”) in accordance

                      your Developer Apps, you must provide us notice of the

                      to do any of the foregoing in this Section 6 will

                          Except as stated in Section 15, these API Terms
                          create no third party beneficiary rights. A
                          party’s failure to enforce a provision is not a
                          waiver of its right to do so later. If a provision
                          is found unenforceable, then the remaining
                          provisions of these API Terms will remain in full
                          effect and an enforceable term will be substituted
                          reflecting our intent as closely as possible. You
                          may not assign any of your rights in these API
